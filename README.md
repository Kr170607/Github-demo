engine.say("The C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories as an evolution of earlier languages like B and BCPL, with the goal of creating a powerful tool for system programming. It was specifically designed to rewrite the UNIX operating system, which marked a major shift in software development by demonstrating that an OS could be written in a high-level language. C introduced structured programming, low-level memory access, and portability across machines, making it ideal for operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems. Its influence is profoundâ€”C became the foundation for many modern languages including C++, Java, and Python, and remains widely used today for its speed, efficiency, and control over hardware.")
